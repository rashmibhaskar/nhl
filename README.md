# A simple web UI application that uses public API endpoints to display NHL team information.
- A league summary page that displays a list or table view with some information (only a few important pieces) about each team in the NHL.
- A team statistics page (or a modal) that displays more statistics about a particular team.
- The user can select a team in the summary page to get to that teamâ€™s stats page.
- The stats page includes more detail about the team (but not necessarily all of the details from the stats API endpoint), and can navigate back to the summary page.
